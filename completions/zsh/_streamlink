        ]"
  {-p,--player}"[
        Player to feed stream data to. By default, VLC will be used if it can be
        found in its default location.

        This is a shell-like syntax to support using a specific player\:

          \%(prog)s --player\=vlc \<url\> \[stream\]

        Absolute or relative paths can also be passed via this option in the
        event the player\'s executable can not be resolved\:

          \%(prog)s --player\=\/path\/to\/vlc \<url\> \[stream\]
          \%(prog)s --player\=.\/vlc-player\/vlc \<url\> \[stream\]

        To use a player that is located in a path with spaces you must quote the
        parameter or its value\:

          \%(prog)s \"--player\=\/path\/with spaces\/vlc\" \<url\> \[stream\]
          \%(prog)s --player \"C\:\\path\\with spaces\\mpc-hc64.exe\" \<url\> \[stream\]

        Options may also be passed to the player. For example\:

          \%(prog)s --player \"vlc --file-caching\=5000\" \<url\> \[stream\]

        As an alternative to this, see the --player-args parameter, which does
        not log any custom player arguments.
        ]:player:"
  {-a,--player-args}"[
        This option allows you to customize the default arguments which are put
        together with the value of --player to create a command to execute.

        It\'s usually enough to only use --player instead of this unless you need
        to add arguments after the player\'s input argument or if you don\'t want
        any of the player arguments to be logged.

        The value can contain formatting variables surrounded by curly braces,
        \`\{\` and \`\}\`. If you need to include a brace character, it can be escaped
        by doubling, e.g. \`\{\{\` and \`\}\}\`.

        Formatting variables available\:

        \{playerinput\}
            This is the input that the player will use. For standard input (stdin),
            it is \`-\` (dash), but it can also be a URL, depending on the options used.

        \{filename\}
            The old fallback variable name with the same functionality.

        Example\:

          \%(prog)s -p vlc -a \"--play-and-exit \{playerinput\}\" \<url\> \[stream\]

        Note\: When neither of the variables are found, \`\{playerinput\}\`
        will be appended to the whole parameter value, to ensure that the player
        always receives an input argument.
        ]:player_args:"
  {-v,--verbose-player}"[
        Allow the player to display its console output.
        ]"
  {-n,--player-fifo,--fifo}"[
        Make the player read the stream through a named pipe instead of the
        stdin pipe.
        ]"
  "--player-http[
        Make the player read the stream through HTTP instead of the stdin pipe.
        ]"
  "--player-continuous-http[
        Make the player read the stream through HTTP, but unlike --player-http
        it will continuously try to open the stream if the player requests it.

        This makes it possible to handle stream disconnects if your player is
        capable of reconnecting to a HTTP stream. This is usually done by
        setting your player to a \"repeat mode\".
        ]"
  "--player-external-http[
        Serve stream data through HTTP without running any player. This is
        useful to allow external devices like smartphones or streaming boxes to
        watch streams they wouldn\'t be able to otherwise.

        The default behavior is similar to the --player-continuous-http option,
        but no player program will be started, and the server will listen on all available
        connections instead of just in the local (loopback) interface.

        See --player-external-http-interface for choosing a specific network interface, and
        see --player-external-http-port for choosing a non-randomized port.

        Optionally, the --player-external-http-continuous option allows for disabling
        the continuous run-mode, so that Streamlink will stop when the stream ends.

        The URLs that can be used to access the stream will be printed to the
        console, and the server can be interrupted using CTRL-C.
        ]"
  "--player-external-http-continuous[
        Set the run-mode of --player-external-http to continuous or non-continuous.

        In the continuous run-mode, Streamlink will keep running after the stream has ended
        and will wait for the next HTTP request being made unless it gets shut down via CTRL-C.

        If set to non-continuous, Streamlink will stop once the stream has ended.

        Default is true.
        ]:player_external_http_continuous:"
  "--player-external-http-interface[
        The network interface on which the HTTP server will be listening on.
        If unset or set to \`0.0.0.0\`, all available interfaces will be bound.
        ]:player_external_http_interface:"
  "--player-external-http-port[
        A fixed port to use for the external HTTP server if that mode is
        enabled. Omit or set to \`0\` to use a random high ( \>1024) port.
        ]:player_external_http_port:"
  "--player-passthrough[
        A comma-delimited list of stream types to pass to the player as a URL to
        let it handle the transport of the stream instead.

        Stream types that can be converted into a playable URL are\:

        - hls
        - http

        Make sure your player can handle the stream type when using this.
        ]:player_passthrough:"
  "--player-no-close[
        By default Streamlink will close the player when the stream
        ends. This is to avoid \"dead\" GUI players lingering after a
        stream ends.

        It does however have the side-effect of sometimes closing a
        player before it has played back all of its cached data.

        This option will instead let the player decide when to exit.
        ]"
  {-t,--title}"[
        Change the title of the video player\'s window.

        Please see the \"Metadata variables\" section of Streamlink\'s CLI documentation for all available metadata variables.

        This option is only supported for the following players\: mpv, potplayer, vlc

        VLC specific information\:
            VLC does support special formatting variables on its own\:
            https\:\/\/wiki.videolan.org\/Documentation\:Format_String\/

            These variables are accessible in the --title option by adding a backslash
            in front of the dollar sign which VLC uses as its formatting character.

            For example, to put the current date in your VLC window title,
            the string \`\\\$A\` could be inserted inside the --title string.

        Example\:

            \%(prog)s -p mpv --title \"\{author\} - \{category\} - \{title\}\" \<URL\> \[STREAM\]
        ]:title:"
  {-o,--output}"[
        Write stream data to \`FILENAME\` instead of playing it. If \`FILENAME\` is set to \`-\` (dash), then the stream data will be
        written to stdout, similar to the --stdout argument.

        Non-existent directories and subdirectories will be created if they do not exist, if filesystem permissions allow.

        You will be prompted if the file already exists.

        Please see the \"Metadata variables\" section of Streamlink\'s CLI documentation for all available metadata variables.

        Unsupported characters in substituted variables will be replaced with an underscore.

        Example\:

            \%(prog)s --output \"\~\/recordings\/\{author\}\/\{category\}\/\{id\}-\{time\:\%\%Y\%\%m\%\%d\%\%H\%\%M\%\%S\}.ts\" \<URL\> \[STREAM\]

  {-r,--record}"[
        Open the stream in the player, while at the same time writing it to \`FILENAME\`. If \`FILENAME\` is set to \`-\` (dash),
        then the stream data will be written to stdout, similar to the --stdout argument, while still opening the player.

        Non-existent directories and subdirectories will be created if they do not exist, if filesystem permissions allow.

        You will be prompted if the file already exists.

        Please see the \"Metadata variables\" section of Streamlink\'s CLI documentation for all available metadata variables.

  "--fs-safe-rules[
        The rules used to make formatting variables filesystem-safe are chosen

  "--url[
        A URL to attempt to extract streams from.

        Usually, the protocol of http(s) URLs can be omitted (\`https\:\/\/\`),
        depending on the implementation of the plugin being used.

  {--stream-types,--stream-priority}"[
        A comma-delimited list of stream types to allow.

        The order will be used to separate streams when there are multiple
        streams with the same name but different stream types. Any stream type
        not listed will be omitted from the available streams list.  An \`\*\` (asterisk) can
        be used as a wildcard to match any other type of stream, eg. muxed-stream.

  "--stream-sorting-excludes[
        Fine tune the \`best\` and \`worst\` stream name synonyms by excluding unwanted streams.

        If all of the available streams get excluded, \`best\` and \`worst\` will become
        inaccessible and new special stream synonyms \`best-unfiltered\` and \`worst-unfiltered\`
        can be used as a fallback selection method.

        Uses a filter expression in the format\:

          \[operator\]\<value\>

        Valid operators are \`\>\`, \`\>\=\`, \`\<\` and \`\<\=\`. If no operator is specified then
        equality is tested.

        For example this will exclude streams ranked higher than \"480p\"\:

          --stream-sorting-excludes \"\>480p\"

        Multiple filters can be used by separating each expression with a comma.

        For example this will exclude streams from two quality types\:

          --stream-sorting-excludes \"\>480p,\>medium\"

        ]:stream_sorting_excludes:"
  "--ringbuffer-size[
        The maximum size of the ringbuffer. Mega- or kilobytes can be specified via the M or K suffix respectively.

        The ringbuffer is used as a temporary storage between the stream and the player.
        This allows Streamlink to download the stream faster than the player which reads the data from the ringbuffer.

        The smaller the size of the ringbuffer, the higher the chance of the player buffering if the download speed decreases,
        and the higher the size, the more data can be use as a storage to recover from volatile download speeds.

        Most players have their own additional cache and will read the ringbuffer\'s content as soon as data is available.
        If the player stops reading data while playback is paused, Streamlink will continue to download the stream in the
        background as long as the ringbuffer doesn\'t get full.

        Default is \"16M\".

        Note\: A smaller size is recommended on lower end systems (such as Raspberry Pi) when playing stream types that require
        some extra processing to avoid unnecessary background processing.

        Number of segments from the live stream\'s current live position to begin streaming.
        The size or length of each segment is determined by the streaming provider.

        Lower values will decrease the latency, but will also increase the chance of buffering, as there is less time for
        Streamlink to download segments and write their data to the output buffer. The number of parallel segment downloads
        can be set with --stream-segment-threads and the HLS playlist reload time to fetch and queue new segments can be
        overridden with --hls-playlist-reload-time.

        Default is 3.

        Note\: During live playback, the caching\/buffering settings of the used player will add additional latency. To adjust

        Reducing --hls-live-edge to \`1\` will result in the lowest latency possible, but will most likely cause buffering.

        In order to achieve true low latency streaming during playback, the player\'s caching\/buffering settings will
        need to be adjusted and reduced to a value as low as possible, but still high enough to not cause any buffering.
        This depends on the stream\'s bitrate and the quality of the connection to Twitch\'s servers. Please refer to the
        player\'s own documentation for the required configuration. Player parameters can be set via --player-args.

        Note\: Low latency streams have to be enabled by the broadcasters on Twitch themselves.
        Regular streams can cause buffering issues with this option enabled due to the reduced --hls-live-edge value.
