            See the Python standard library\'s \`logging.Formatter\` docs for more information about the logging format
            and the available \`LogRecord\` attributes. Streamlink\'s formatter uses the curly brace style.

            The default format depends on the chosen log level (may include the \`asctime\` attribute).

            Set the player executable that will be launched (unless a different output method was chosen).

            Either set an absolute or relative path to the player executable, or just set the executable\'s name
            if it can be resolved from the paths of the system\'s \`PATH\` environment variable.

            In addition to setting the player executable path, custom player arguments can be set via --player-args.

            Note\: In the past, --player allowed defining additional player arguments, which as a consequence required wrapping
            player paths that contained spaces in quotation marks. This is unsupported since release \`6.0.0\`.

            Default is VLC player, if available.
        ]:player:"
  {-a,--player-args}"[
            Set a string of custom --player launch arguments that will be parsed and tokenized.

            The value can contain formatting variables surrounded by curly braces, \`\{\` and \`\}\`.
            Curly brace characters can be escaped by doubling, e.g. \`\{\{\` and \`\}\}\`.

            Available formatting variables\:

            \`\{playerinput\}\`
                This is the input argument that the --player will receive. For standard input (stdin),
                it is \`-\` (dash), but it can also be a file path or URL, depending on the options used.
                If unset, then the player input argument will be appended to the parsed player arguments list.

            \`\{playertitleargs\}\`
                The automatically generated player title arguments, if a supported --player was found. See --title for more.
                If unset, automatically generated player title arguments will be prepended to the parsed player arguments list.

            Example\:

              streamlink -p vlc -a \"--play-and-exit --no-one-instance\" \<url\> \[stream\]

            Default is \"\".

        ]"
  "--player-continuous-http[
            Make the --player read the stream through HTTP, but unlike --player-http,
            it will continuously try to open the stream if the player requests it.

            This enables the handling of stream disconnects if the player is
            capable of reconnecting to a HTTP stream. This is usually done by
            setting the player to a \"repeat mode\".
        ]"
  "--player-external-http[
            Serve stream data through HTTP without opening the --player. This is
            useful to allow external devices like smartphones or streaming boxes to
            watch streams they wouldn\'t be able to otherwise.

            The default behavior is similar to the --player-continuous-http option,
            but no player program will be started, and the server will listen on all available
            connections instead of just in the local (loopback) interface.

            See --player-external-http-interface for choosing a specific network interface, and
            see --player-external-http-port for choosing a non-randomized port.

            Optionally, the --player-external-http-continuous option allows for disabling
            the continuous run-mode, so that Streamlink will stop when the stream ends.

            The URLs that can be used to access the stream will be printed to the
            console, and the server can be interrupted using CTRL-C.
        ]"
  "--player-external-http-continuous[
            Set the run-mode of --player-external-http to continuous or non-continuous.

            In the continuous run-mode, Streamlink will keep running after the stream has ended
            and will wait for the next HTTP request being made unless it gets shut down via CTRL-C.

            If set to non-continuous, Streamlink will stop once the stream has ended.

            Default is true.
        ]:player_external_http_continuous:"
  "--player-external-http-interface[
            Set the network interface on which the HTTP server will be listening on.

        ]:player_external_http_port:"
  "--player-passthrough[
            A comma-delimited list of stream types to pass to the --player as a URL to
            let it handle the transport of the stream instead of Streamlink.

            Stream types that can be converted into a playable URL are\:

            hls, http

            Make sure the player can handle the stream type when using this.
        ]:player_passthrough:"
  "--player-no-close[
            By default, Streamlink will close the --player when the stream ends.
            This is to avoid \"dead\" GUI players lingering after Streamlink has exited.

            It does however have the side-effect of sometimes closing a
            player before it has played back all of its cached data.

            This option will instead let the player decide when to exit.
        ]"
  {-t,--title}"[
            Change the title of the --player\'s window.

            Write stream data to \`FILENAME\` instead of playing it in the --player.
            If \`FILENAME\` is set to \`-\` (dash), then the stream data will be written to \`stdout\`,
            similar to the --stdout argument.

            Directories and subdirectories will be created if they do not exist, if filesystem permissions allow.

            Unless --force is set, Streamlink will ask for confirmation before writing if \`FILENAME\` already exists.

            as well as the \"Plugins\" section for the list of metadata variables defined in each plugin.

            Unsupported characters in substituted variables will be replaced with an underscore.

            Example\:

                streamlink --output \"\~\/recordings\/\{author\}\/\{category\}\/\{id\}-\{time\:\%Y\%m\%d\%H\%M\%S\}.ts\" \<URL\> \[STREAM\]

            similar to the --stdout argument, while still opening the player.

            Directories and subdirectories will be created if they do not exist, if filesystem permissions allow.

  "--stream-sorting-excludes[
            Fine-tune the \`best\` and \`worst\` stream name synonyms by excluding unwanted streams.

            If all of the available streams get excluded, \`best\` and \`worst\` will become
            inaccessible and new special stream synonyms \`best-unfiltered\` and \`worst-unfiltered\`

            The maximum size of the ringbuffer.

            Mebibytes or kibibytes (base 2) can be specified via the M or K suffix respectively.

            The ringbuffer is used as a temporary storage between the stream and the player.
            This allows Streamlink to download the stream faster than the player which reads the data from the ringbuffer.

            The smaller the size of the ringbuffer, the higher the chance of the player buffering if the download speed
            decreases, and the higher the size, the more data can be use as a storage to recover from volatile download speeds.

            Most players have their own additional cache and will read the ringbuffer\'s content as soon as data is available.
            If the player stops reading data while playback is paused, Streamlink will continue to download the stream in the

            The size or length of each segment is determined by the streaming provider.

            Lower values will decrease the latency, but will also increase the chance of buffering, as there is less time for
            Streamlink to download segments and write their data to the output buffer. The number of parallel segment downloads

  "--hls-segment-queue-threshold[
            The multiplication factor of the HLS playlist\'s target duration after which the stream will be stopped early
            if no new segments were queued after refreshing the playlist (multiple times). The target duration defines the
            maximum duration a single segment can have, meaning new segments must be available during this time frame,
            otherwise playback issues can occur.

            The intention of this queue threshold is to be able to stop early when the end of a stream doesn\'t get
            announced by the server, so Streamlink doesn\'t have to wait until a read-timeout occurs. See --stream-timeout.

            Set to \`\`0\`\` to disable.

  "--webbrowser[
            Enable or disable support for Streamlink\'s webbrowser API.

            Streamlink\'s webbrowser API allows plugins which implement it to launch a web browser and extract data from websites
            which they otherwise couldn\'t do via the regular HTTP session in Python due to specific JavaScript restrictions.

            The web browser is run isolated and in a clean environment without access to regular user data.

            Streamlink currently only supports Chromium-based web browsers using the Chrome Devtools Protocol (CDP).
            This includes Chromium itself, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, and others, but full support for
            third party Chromium forks is not guaranteed. Please try Chromium or Google Chrome when encountering any issues.

            Default is true.

        Reducing --hls-live-edge to \`1\` will result in the lowest latency possible, but will most likely cause buffering.

        In order to achieve true low latency streaming during playback, the player\'s caching\/buffering settings will
        need to be adjusted and reduced to a value as low as possible, but still high enough to not cause any buffering.
        This depends on the stream\'s bitrate and the quality of the connection to Twitch\'s servers. Please refer to the
        player\'s own documentation for the required configuration. Player parameters can be set via --player-args.

        Note\: Low latency streams have to be enabled by the broadcasters on Twitch themselves.
