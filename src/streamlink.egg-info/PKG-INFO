        Streamlink is a CLI utility that pipes flash videos from online streaming services to a variety of video players such as VLC.
        
        The main purpose of streamlink is to convert CPU-heavy flash plugins to a less CPU-intensive format.
        
        Streamlink is a fork of the [Livestreamer][livestreamer] project.
