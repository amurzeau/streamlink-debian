.SH PLAYER OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-p COMMAND
.TP
.B \-\-player COMMAND
Player to feed stream data to. By default, VLC will be used if it can be
found in its default location.
.sp
This is a shell\-like syntax to support using a specific player:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
streamlink \-\-player=vlc <url> [stream]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Absolute or relative paths can also be passed via this option in the
event the player\(aqs executable can not be resolved:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
streamlink \-\-player=/path/to/vlc <url> [stream]
streamlink \-\-player=./vlc\-player/vlc <url> [stream]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To use a player that is located in a path with spaces you must quote the
parameter or its value:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
streamlink "\-\-player=/path/with spaces/vlc" <url> [stream]
streamlink \-\-player "C:\epath\ewith spaces\empc\-hc64.exe" <url> [stream]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Options may also be passed to the player. For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
streamlink \-\-player "vlc \-\-file\-caching=5000" <url> [stream]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
As an alternative to this, see the \fB\-\-player\-args\fP parameter, which does
not log any custom player arguments.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a ARGUMENTS
.TP
.B \-\-player\-args ARGUMENTS
This option allows you to customize the default arguments which are put
together with the value of \fB\-\-player\fP to create a command to execute.
.sp
It\(aqs usually enough to only use \fB\-\-player\fP instead of this unless you need
to add arguments after the player\(aqs input argument or if you don\(aqt want
any of the player arguments to be logged.
.sp
The value can contain formatting variables surrounded by curly braces,
{ and }. If you need to include a brace character, it can be escaped
by doubling, e.g. {{ and }}.
.sp
Formatting variables available:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B {playerinput}
This is the input that the player will use. For standard input (stdin),
it is \fB\-\fP, but it can also be a URL, depending on the options used.
.TP
.B {filename}
The old fallback variable name with the same functionality.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
streamlink \-p vlc \-a "\-\-play\-and\-exit {playerinput}" <url> [stream]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
When neither of the variables are found, \fB{playerinput}\fP
will be appended to the whole parameter value, to ensure that the player
always receives an input argument.

.B \-v
.TP
.B \-\-verbose\-player
Allow the player to display its console output.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-n
.TP
.B \-\-player\-fifo
.TP
.B \-\-fifo
Make the player read the stream through a named pipe instead of the
stdin pipe.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-player\-http
Make the player read the stream through HTTP instead of the stdin pipe.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-player\-continuous\-http
Make the player read the stream through HTTP, but unlike \fB\-\-player\-http\fP
it will continuously try to open the stream if the player requests it.
.sp
This makes it possible to handle stream disconnects if your player is
capable of reconnecting to a HTTP stream. This is usually done by
setting your player to a "repeat mode".
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-player\-external\-http
Serve stream data through HTTP without running any player. This is
useful to allow external devices like smartphones or streaming boxes to
watch streams they wouldn\(aqt be able to otherwise.
.sp
Behavior will be similar to the continuous HTTP option, but no player
program will be started, and the server will listen on all available
connections instead of just in the local (loopback) interface.
.sp
The URLs that can be used to access the stream will be printed to the
console, and the server can be interrupted using CTRL\-C.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-player\-external\-http\-port PORT
A fixed port to use for the external HTTP server if that mode is
enabled. Omit or set to 0 to use a random high ( >1024) port.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-player\-passthrough TYPES
A comma\-delimited list of stream types to pass to the player as a URL to
let it handle the transport of the stream instead.
.sp
Stream types that can be converted into a playable URL are:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
hls
.IP \(bu 2
http
.IP \(bu 2
rtmp
.UNINDENT
.sp
Make sure your player can handle the stream type when using this.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-player\-no\-close
By default Streamlink will close the player when the stream
ends. This is to avoid "dead" GUI players lingering after a
stream ends.
.sp
It does however have the side\-effect of sometimes closing a
player before it has played back all of its cached data.
.sp
This option will instead let the player decide when to exit.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-t TITLE
.TP
.B \-\-title TITLE
This option allows you to supply a title to be displayed in the
title bar of the window that the video player is launched in.
.sp
This value can contain formatting variables surrounded by curly braces,
{ and }. If you need to include a brace character, it can be escaped
by doubling, e.g. {{ and }}.
.sp
This option is only supported for the following players: mpv, potplayer, vlc.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B VLC specific information:
VLC has certain codes you can use inside your title.
These are accessible inside \-\-title by using a backslash
before the dollar sign VLC uses to denote a format character.
.sp
e.g. to put the current date in your VLC window title,
the string "$A" could be inserted inside your \-\-title string.
.sp
A full list of the format codes VLC uses is available here:
\fI\%https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Format_String/\fP
.TP
.B mpv specific information:
mpv has certain codes you can use inside your title.
These are accessible inside \-\-title by using a backslash
before the dollar sign mpv uses to denote a format character.
.sp
e.g. to put the current version of mpv running inside your
mpv window title, the string "${{mpv\-version}}" could be
inserted inside your \-\-title string.
.sp
A full list of the format codes mpv uses is available here:
\fI\%https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#property\-list\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Formatting variables available to use in \fB\-\-title\fP:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B {title}
If available, this is the title of the stream.
Otherwise, it is the string "Unknown Title"
.TP
.B {author}
If available, this is the author of the stream.
Otherwise, it is the string "Unknown Author"
.TP
.B {category}
If available, this is the category the stream has been placed into.
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
For Twitch, this is the game being played
.IP \(bu 2
For YouTube, it\(aqs the category e.g. Gaming, Sports, Music...
.UNINDENT
.sp
Otherwise, it is the string "No Category"
.TP
.B {game}
This is just a synonym for {category} which may make more sense for
gaming oriented platforms. "Game being played" is a way to categorize
the stream, so it doesn\(aqt need its own separate handling.
.TP
.B {url}
URL of the stream.
.TP
.B {time}
The current timestamp, which can optionally be formatted via {time:format}.
This format parameter string is passed to Python\(aqs datetime.strftime() method,
so all usual time directives are available. The default format is "%Y\-%m\-%d_%H\-%M\-%S".

.B \-\-ringbuffer\-size SIZE
The maximum size of the ringbuffer. Mega\- or kilobytes can be specified via the M or K suffix respectively.
.sp
The ringbuffer is used as a temporary storage between the stream and the player.
This allows Streamlink to download the stream faster than the player which reads the data from the ringbuffer.
.sp
The smaller the size of the ringbuffer, the higher the chance of the player buffering if the download speed decreases,
and the higher the size, the more data can be use as a storage to recover from volatile download speeds.
.sp
Most players have their own additional cache and will read the ringbuffer\(aqs content as soon as data is available.
If the player stops reading data while playback is paused, Streamlink will continue to download the stream in the
background as long as the ringbuffer doesn\(aqt get full.
.sp
Default is: \fB"16M"\fP\&.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
