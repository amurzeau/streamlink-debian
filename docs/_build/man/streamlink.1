.sp
Either set an absolute or relative path to the player executable, or just set the executable\(aqs name
if it can be resolved from the paths of the system\(aqs \fBPATH\fP environment variable.
.sp
In addition to setting the player executable path, custom player arguments can be set via \fI\%\-\-player\-args\fP\&.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
In the past, \fI\%\-\-player\fP allowed defining additional player arguments, which as a consequence required wrapping
player paths that contained spaces in quotation marks. This is unsupported since release \fB6.0.0\fP\&.

Default is: \fBVLC player, if available\fP\&.

.B \-a ARGUMENTS
.TP
.B \-\-player\-args ARGUMENTS
This option allows the arguments which are used to launch the player process to be customized.
.sp
The value can contain formatting variables surrounded by curly braces, \fB{\fP and \fB}\fP\&.
Curly brace characters can be escaped by doubling, e.g. \fB{{\fP and \fB}}\fP\&.
.sp
Available formatting variables:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB{playerinput}\fP
This is the input argument that the player will receive. For standard input (stdin),
it is \fB\-\fP (dash), but it can also be a file path or URL, depending on the options used.
If unset, then the player input argument will be appended to the parsed player arguments list.
.TP
.B \fB{playertitleargs}\fP
The automatically generated player title arguments, if a supported player was found. See \fI\%\-\-title\fP for more.
If unset, automatically generated player title arguments will be prepended to the parsed player arguments list.

Make the player read the stream through a named pipe instead of the
stdin pipe.

.TP
.B \-\-player\-http
Make the player read the stream through HTTP instead of the stdin pipe.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-player\-continuous\-http
Make the player read the stream through HTTP, but unlike \fI\%\-\-player\-http\fP
it will continuously try to open the stream if the player requests it.
.sp
This makes it possible to handle stream disconnects if your player is
capable of reconnecting to a HTTP stream. This is usually done by
setting your player to a \(dqrepeat mode\(dq.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-player\-external\-http
Serve stream data through HTTP without running any player. This is
useful to allow external devices like smartphones or streaming boxes to
watch streams they wouldn\(aqt be able to otherwise.
.sp
The default behavior is similar to the \fI\%\-\-player\-continuous\-http\fP option,
but no player program will be started, and the server will listen on all available
connections instead of just in the local (loopback) interface.
.sp
See \fI\%\-\-player\-external\-http\-interface\fP for choosing a specific network interface, and
see \fI\%\-\-player\-external\-http\-port\fP for choosing a non\-randomized port.
.sp
Optionally, the \fI\%\-\-player\-external\-http\-continuous\fP option allows for disabling
the continuous run\-mode, so that Streamlink will stop when the stream ends.
.sp
The URLs that can be used to access the stream will be printed to the
console, and the server can be interrupted using CTRL\-C.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-player\-external\-http\-continuous {yes,true,1,on,no,false,0,off}
Set the run\-mode of \fI\%\-\-player\-external\-http\fP to continuous or non\-continuous.
.sp
In the continuous run\-mode, Streamlink will keep running after the stream has ended
and will wait for the next HTTP request being made unless it gets shut down via CTRL\-C.
.sp
If set to non\-continuous, Streamlink will stop once the stream has ended.
.sp
Default is: \fBtrue\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-player\-external\-http\-interface INTERFACE
The network interface on which the HTTP server will be listening on.
If unset or set to \fB0.0.0.0\fP, all available interfaces will be bound.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-player\-external\-http\-port PORT
A fixed port to use for the external HTTP server if that mode is
enabled. Omit or set to \fB0\fP to use a random high ( >1024) port.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-player\-passthrough TYPES
A comma\-delimited list of stream types to pass to the player as a URL to
let it handle the transport of the stream instead.
.sp
Stream types that can be converted into a playable URL are:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
hls
.IP \(bu 2
http
.UNINDENT
.sp
Make sure your player can handle the stream type when using this.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-player\-no\-close
By default Streamlink will close the player when the stream
ends. This is to avoid \(dqdead\(dq GUI players lingering after a
stream ends.
.sp
It does however have the side\-effect of sometimes closing a
player before it has played back all of its cached data.
.sp
This option will instead let the player decide when to exit.

.B \-t TITLE
.TP
.B \-\-title TITLE
Change the title of the video player\(aqs window.
.sp
Please see the \(dq\fI\%Metadata variables\fP\(dq section of Streamlink\(aqs CLI documentation for all available metadata variables.
.sp
This option is only supported for the following players: mpv, potplayer, vlc
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B VLC specific information:
VLC does support special formatting variables on its own:
\fI\%https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Format_String/\fP
.sp
These variables are accessible in the \fI\%\-\-title\fP option by adding a backslash
in front of the dollar sign which VLC uses as its formatting character.
.sp
For example, to put the current date in your VLC window title,
the string \fB\e$A\fP could be inserted inside the \fI\%\-\-title\fP string.

.B \-\-ringbuffer\-size SIZE
The maximum size of the ringbuffer. Mega\- or kilobytes can be specified via the M or K suffix respectively.
.sp
The ringbuffer is used as a temporary storage between the stream and the player.
This allows Streamlink to download the stream faster than the player which reads the data from the ringbuffer.
.sp
The smaller the size of the ringbuffer, the higher the chance of the player buffering if the download speed decreases,
and the higher the size, the more data can be use as a storage to recover from volatile download speeds.
.sp
Most players have their own additional cache and will read the ringbuffer\(aqs content as soon as data is available.
If the player stops reading data while playback is paused, Streamlink will continue to download the stream in the
background as long as the ringbuffer doesn\(aqt get full.

.B \-\-hls\-live\-edge SEGMENTS
Number of segments from the live stream\(aqs current live position to begin streaming.
The size or length of each segment is determined by the streaming provider.
.sp
Lower values will decrease the latency, but will also increase the chance of buffering, as there is less time for
Streamlink to download segments and write their data to the output buffer. The number of parallel segment downloads
can be set with \fI\%\-\-stream\-segment\-threads\fP and the HLS playlist reload time to fetch and queue new segments can be
overridden with \fI\%\-\-hls\-playlist\-reload\-time\fP\&.
.sp
Default is: \fB3\fP\&.

During live playback, the caching/buffering settings of the used player will add additional latency. To adjust
